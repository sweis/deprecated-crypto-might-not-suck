Old Crypto Projects that Might have not Sucked Years Ago
===================================

**Note: I stopped maintaining this in 2018, so it's very out of date.**


This document originated with an informal survey of Twitter and several mailing lists asking for nominations for crypto projects that "didn't suck". It is from ~2014-2018 and is very out of date. Take it as a historical document. Over 100 nominations were received and culled down to this list. Projects marked with an "☢" symbol were relatively new and considered experimental at the time. Apologies to project creators who are omitted. Corrections are welcome via pull request.
